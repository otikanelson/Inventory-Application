✅ **Let them touch the device**
   - Hand them the phone during demo
   
✅ **Pause for questions**
   - Engage, don't lecture

### Don'ts:
❌ **Don't use technical jargon**
   - Say "smart predictions" not "machine learning algorithms"
   
❌ **Don't rush**
   - Let features sink in

   - Be honest about limitations
   
❌ **Don't skip the problem**
